This program was developed as a study aid. It works like flash cards but with
the added advantage that it keeps track of which cards you have problems with
and shows only those cards. Cards that are answered correctly the first time
are marked and are not shown again until cleared by the user. Those that are
answered incorrectly are reshown at random until they are answered correctly,
and they will reappear in new sessions until they are answered right the
first time in any of those sessions.
