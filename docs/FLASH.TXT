This program was developed as a study aid. It works like flash cards but with
the added advantage that it keeps track of which cards you have problems with
and shows only those cards. Cards that are answered correctly the first time
are marked and are not shown again until cleared by the user. Those that are
answered incorrectly are reshown at random until they are answered correctly,
and they will reappear in new sessions until they are answered right the
first time in any of those sessions.

You can use the cards provided or you can make up your own to study anything
that can be put on flash cards. When you miss a question you will be shown
the correct answer. The computer will keep track of your progress and show
you your score. In studying the cards you can use multiple choice or the
honor system.

You can select a data file to use by specifying it on the command line, for
example "flash span-eng.rec" to use the data file "span-eng.rec". By default
flash is set to multiple choice only. If you wish to enable the honor system
option you must specify /h on the command line, eg. "flash span-eng.rec /h".
In the honor system you guess the answer & then after you are shown the
right answer YOU tell the computer wether you guessed it correctly or not.

Any wordprocessor may be used to make a data file provided that it is capable
of saving the file as an Ascii text file without hidden or special characters.
If in doubt as to wether a file fits this description you can perform a TYPE
command on it and if it does not beep or print strange characters which are
not part of the alphabet then it is probably an Ascii text file you can use.

An example of a data file is illustrated below:

00 question=answer
30 another question=and another answer
0F yet another=and one more answer

The two digits preceding the question is a hex number. This number records the
users who have answered the question correctly the first time they encountered
it in any given session. Following the first space is your first question,
this is delimited by the "=" sign. Following the equal sign is the answer.
Questions & answers are each limited in size to 79 characters.

If you make a new data file or add cards to an existing file you need to put
put 00 in front of the question, as in the first question & answer in the
example above, eg "00 loco=crazy".
