I've made a study program called flash and made it available to anyone in
"/home/p/kurth/pub/flash". To use it make and/or change to the directory 
where you want to use it and do "cp /home/p/kurth/pub/flash/* ." (don't
forget that little period on the end) and then type "flash" to run it. 

I also have DOS and Linux versions which will work on an IBM compatible PC. 
Just give me an empty formatted 3.5" diskette and I'll give it back to you
with the program and some study files (including Spanish if you want it).

The program and study files are continually being improved or added to so 
check the above directory for later versions of the program or additions 
to the study files. You can use the study files provided but you can also
design your own, which is the major reason I wrote the thing in the first 
place.

The idea of the program is to have it show you flash cards and keep track
of which ones you got right or wrong. Each time you start up the program
you enter a new "session". The questions you are able to answer correctly
THE FIRST TIME in that session are marked and are not repeated in that or
future sessions. Other questions you get right after one or more 
unsuccessful attempts will be repeated in future sessions until you get them
right the first time in one of those sessions. Eventually when you've gotten
them all right you can clear the marks to practice them again.

How do you answer the questions? Either by the "honor system" method or
multiple choice. For "honor system" you press a key after being shown the
question, then when you have mentally answered the question to yourself
you press a key and are shown the correct answer, then YOU tell it if you
got it correct or not and it marks it accordingly. All it does is keep track 
of which ones you got right the first time, and thereafter tests you only 
on the others, until you get them all right. It's not much, but it does help 
make your self-quizzing a bit more automated and objective so you can tell 
if you really DO remember the answers.

 For multiple choice you are presented with a question and multiple answers
taken at random from all the answers in the file. It works best for 
questions and answers that are short, eg spanish/english cards. Not so
helpful for our class.

There are a couple of files that end in ".rec". Those are the study files
and contain questions and answers. I've put one with the questions and
anwsers from the actual economic botany quiz 2, also one I did of all 
the study questions UP TO quiz 2. I'll be putting in more as we get them
in class.

I haven't filled in all the answers, and those that I did fill in you may 
disagree with, so feel free to edit the file to suit your own preferences.
 To edit the file just make sure to make each line of the following form:

00 yourquestion=youranswer}
00 anotherquest=anotherans}
