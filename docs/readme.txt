Changes from last version:
* Removed multiple choice option.
* Change "Type in Letter" to "Type in Answer". This is most suitable for multiple choice
type questions which have short answer like a or b (the meaning of which can be in the question).
* Fixed error when clearing stats on Linux on a data file created in DOS
* Reformatted, code cleanup
* Screenshots

TODO:
* Finish migration from using hex to decimal or boolean to mark cards for stats.
* The card data files needs to change from my ad hoc structure to something standard that users already understand and can easily use to create or edit cards. CSV perhaps.
