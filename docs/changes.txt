23 Apr 96: Added -m option to allow user selection for number of maximum
cards per session, updated flash.doc

28 Apr 96: Added capability to have carriage returns as part of question or
answer, so that multiple line or multipart questions/answers can be displayed
as user intended instead of as one long string. Unfortunately makes the data
file a little more complicated: now have to put a } character at the end of
each answer so the program knows where it stops. This was formerly done by
a carriage return char. Updated doc for flash.

Added score to display. Increments by one for every correct answer
if got it the first time this session. Just like on a real test. The ones 
answered wrong or answered right after a previous try this session are not
counted. Also added percentage display (correct first time divided by session
total). Updated doc.

Added "pick a letter" option that allows user to select by entering
letter that matches correct answer. Only good for questions that have been 
entered using scheme such as:
Pick correct letter
a. this is A
b. this is B
only the first char of the answer is compared (so 'a' == "a letter B")

Added display of type of option picked for testing, to go along
with score (so, no cheating).

Fixed bug that was causing multiple choice to say wrong answer when it was
an identical but "different" answer (because belonged to another question, that 
had an identical answer but different address).

30 Apr 96: Added feature of skipping leading spaces and newlines between the
'=' after the question and the start of the answer so that when long answers
are typed into the study file they can be started on a new line, so you can
see how they will look when the program displays them
