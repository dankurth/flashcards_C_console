  Notes on flash program developments

  Registration numbers will be composed of: the first letter of the persons
last name, the date registered & time registered.
  The date is important as it will indicate which changes are incorporated for
the program.


  11-11-91 Added _retpwd.c which checks command line argument and compares it
to string encoded within flash.exe. If no match then performs _chksums.c to
see if there have been any alterations to flash.exe or to flash.doc, if
matches it does not check for alterations. This allows me to modify the
program and run it without having to run _codesum.c to update the checksums
thus making for faster & easier development of the program. The command line
argument within flash.exe has been encoded using _encode.c to prevent others
from using a command line argument to allow their own modifications. Garbage
characters have also been put in the string array used by _retpwd.c for
comparison to further confuse potential hackers, it is overwritten by the
correct values which are decoded by _retpwd.c for comparison to the command
line argument, the correct values also were selected at random and thus also
even when decoded appear to be only garbage. Also added screen composed of
first 5 lines of flash.doc which is displayed for approx. 7 seconds to show
name of program, registered owner and registration number.

15 Mar 92- I am going to call the flash projects fc2,fc3 etc. this way I can
retain the preceding source files for each revision. In making the change from
fc2 to fc3 I am going to drop the fixed length data file and use a sequential
file instead. This should slow down read time but will take up a lot less space
on disk. Also I am going to read/write in ascii so that the user can use a
wordprocessor to edit cards, easier for them and smaller program for me since I
don't have to include an editor. Maybe I'll write a tiny editor later to include
as an option, but nowadays everyone will have some editor that they prefer to
use to write in ascii.
